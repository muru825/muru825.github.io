# The Why

The world is sort of a mess right now. I suppose every generation thinks they have it the worst. When the Baby Boomer Generation saw the world englufed by war and unspeakable horrors in their childhood, they must have thought they had it the worst. When they came to age, they now hand to contend with the fears of nuclear war. These fears that are so dificult to live with. 

My generation is condending with horrors, exacerbated by Donald Trump. We fear our long term Job Prospects thanks to the fears created By AI. I feel like my economics  education and the China shock literature indicates that compensating the loosers this time will not work. 

I'm starting this blog for my own therapy. It is somewhat hidden on my website, not for public consumption. On some level, its a place to save my favorite photos as I start this new hobby. But it is also one of the few art forms I feel I can fully engage in given my disablity. 

That disability defines me. I had a discussion once with my ex about what it means to be disabled, and how to handle the way the world treats me in response. We met in Ballroom dancing, and wanted to be more competitive about it. We had started to dance together exclusivly during practices, and I could tell it was making her sad. This led to an intense and emotional discussion, about what the world, and she owed me in response to this disablity. She couldn't help her competitive desires, but I explained that I didn't really have a choice in the matter, my disablity meant any phisical competition I engaged in could ever be for fun. If I took it as serious as I actually wanted to, I'd become miserable comparing myself to those who do not face the same challenges. And because of that, I can't take it as seriously as she wanted to.

Perhaps that was the first sign that things would not work out between us.

## Piedmont Street

My ex and I spent some time here. There is a tea shop here she loves called Tea on Piedmont. It is fantastic, and that is coming from a fan of coffee. 

**Why I like this photo**: It seems a little underexposed, but it does capture the color juxtaposition between the wondrous color of the leaves versus the dark green christmas tree.

## Telegraph at Night for Christmas
