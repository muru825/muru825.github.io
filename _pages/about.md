I'm a senior at the University of California, Berkeley, where I study Data Science and Economics, advised by [Prof. Serina Chang](https://serinachang5.github.io/). Iâ€™m interested in exploring how Machine Learning can be applied in social science contexts. 



**Areas of Interest: Computational Social Science, Natural Language Processing, Computational Precision Health**

## Current Project

I'm currently working with [Prof. Serina Chang](https://serinachang5.github.io/) exploring how LLMs (or AI in general) can predict public opinions on current events.
