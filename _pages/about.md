Hello! I’m Murari Ganesan, a senior at the University of California, Berkeley, where I study Data Science and Economics. I’m passionate about using data to tackle real-world challenges—whether that’s uncovering insights through causal econometric models or building predictive machine-learning tools. I’ve become fluent in Python, R, SQL, Java and C++, and I enjoy working across the entire data pipeline: gathering and cleaning datasets, designing experiments, and translating results into clear recommendations.

Beyond technical skills, I thrive in collaborative, interdisciplinary environments. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a Ph.D., either in computer science or economics.
